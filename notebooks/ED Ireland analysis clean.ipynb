      " The board operates through Irish supported by KETB; this is good practice that shows example to the school community in general\n",
      " The priorities identified by the board for development are: school planning, review of the school's improvement plan, review of posts, setting up a student support committee, re-establishing a teaching and learning committee, improving digital communication, improved support for new teachers and establishing a support program for the Irish language, building on partnerships with other organisations\n",
      " To date, work on literacy development has been undertaken in these areas: identifying common mistakes, the development of learning intentions at the beginning of lessons, an emphasis on complex terminology in Irish, the provision of book boxes, the Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) scheme in both languages, and it was decided this year to focus on the first-year students' oral ability to develop self confidence in line with the skills development of the new Junior Cycle\n",
