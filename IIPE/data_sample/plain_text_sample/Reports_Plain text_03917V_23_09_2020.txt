The school operates under the patronage of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and participates in Delivering Equality of Opportunity to Schools (DEIS), the action plan of the Department of Education and Skills for educational inclusion. There are 136 pupils enrolled currently; pupil attendance and punctuality are very good. Staffing includes an administrative principal, seven mainstream teachers and four support teachers for pupils with special educational needs (SEN). One support teacher is part-time and based in another school. The school has the services of a shared home-school-community-liaison co-ordinator.   SUMMARY OF MAIN FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:  FINDINGS  The school is managed very effectively; the board of management and principal demonstrate very well developed leadership skills.   Teaching is good with very good methodologies observed in almost all lessons; pupils’ learning experiences in infant classes are of a very high quality.   Pupils’ learning is commendable with pupils attaining very well in English reading and Mathematics; pupils’ writing skills require development.  Assessment is effective overall, although there is significant variation in the quality of teachers’ individual practice.  Support for pupils’ wellbeing is very good; the school is a calm, respectful learning environment in which pupils’ self-confidence is nurtured.  School self-evaluation (SSE) is effective; while DEIS planning impacts positively on learning, more specific targets and more structured monitoring of the implementation of targets would enhance its impact.     RECOMMENDATIONS  Whole-school approaches to writing and to the presentation of written work across the genres should be implemented.   Whole-school approaches to assessment should develop further to ensure consistent impact on teaching and learning.  Greater clarity in the setting of whole-school improvement targets and in the ongoing monitoring of progress towards these targets is necessary to enhance the impact of DEIS planning on learning.  DETAILED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  1. THE QUALITY OF PUPILS’ LEARNING  Pupils’ learning is good; pupils are motivated, attentive and very positively disposed to learning. In a few instances, pupils’ listening skills could be developed further.   Learning experiences are very good and take place in a range of contexts. Digital technologies are successfully integrated across the curriculum. The schools’ participation in the Department’s Creative Clusters initiative impacts positively on pupils’ learning. Pupils’ learning experiences in the infant classes are very good; learning is pupil-led, playful, and occurs in an excellent learning environment.   The local environment is used effectively to support learning and pupils have a good knowledge of local history. While pupils engage regularly in active learning experiences in Social Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) and are able to describe their learning, there is potential to further develop their skills in this area.   Literacy outcomes are commendable; pupils are articulate and eager to share their learning. The school has appropriately targeted pupils’ motivation to read and the resultant development of a culture of reading is highly commended. Many pupils are achieving very good outcomes in reading. While current reading interventions are very successful, some pupils’ reading experiences could be extended further through the use of appropriately challenging texts.

Pupils display a positive attitude to Irish and they are motivated to learn.   The school has identified that pupils’ writing shows potential for development. There is need to ensure that pupils’ writing outcomes are broadly commensurate with their reading abilities. A whole-school approach to the teaching of writing should be implemented.  Pupils’ numeracy outcomes are very good; pupils demonstrate a positivity towards Mathematics, use mathematical language precisely and have well-developed computational and procedural skills.   2. THE QUALITY OF TEACHING  Teaching is good overall, with many examples of very good teaching observed. Active and collaborative methodologies are well embedded in teachers’ practice.   Teachers share expertise and lead aspects of school development willingly. As their engagement in the school improvement process becomes embedded, there is potential for teachers to engage in greater collective reflection on practice.    Tá gnéithe le forbairt maidir le teagasc na Gaeilge. Sna ceachtanna a breathnaíodh, sonraíodh eiliminití d’aistriúchán sa teagasc; b’fhiú an cleachtas seo a sheachaint. There are aspects for development in respect to the teaching of Irish. In the lessons observed, elements of translation were observed in the teaching; it is advised that such practice be avoided.   While teaching in Mathematics is very effective, there were a few lessons observed which were overly focused on pupil activity and would have benefited from additional plenary sessions to consolidate learning. A very good emphasis is placed on the use of mathematical games although pupils should be consistently facilitated to recognise the mathematical principles underlying these games.  The teaching of content in SESE is effective; a greater balance between the acquisition of knowledge and the development of skills will enhance learning.   Provision for pupils with SEN is effective and very well coordinated. The school is ensuring that the use of Classroom Support Plans, as part of the Continuum of Support, becomes embedded in teachers’ practice. In general, targets in pupils’ support plans should be more specifically stated. A range of effective interventions are in place to support pupils and a number of these interventions are highly effective. All interventions should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to meet pupils’ needs.   Assessment is effective overall, although a significant variation in teachers’ practice is evident, ranging from fair to excellent. Where approaches to assessment are highly effective, assessment files include very clear observations of pupils’ learning needs and progress, and detailed skills-focused checklists. In a few classes, pupils benefit from excellent formative feedback on their written work; however, in a few other classes, there is an absence of such feedback and the standard of pupils’ written work shows scope for improvement. Whole-school approaches to assessment require development to ensure a consistent impact on teaching and learning.   3. THE QUALITY OF SUPPORT FOR PUPILS’ WELL-BEING  Support for pupils’ wellbeing is very good. In Inspectorate questionnaires, most pupils reported that they like this school. While structures are in place to support the development of pupil voice, there is potential for these to become further embedded.  Overall, pupils behave very well and engage very well in learning. The school is a calm, affirming and respectful learning environment in which pupils’ self-confidence is nurtured. A wide range of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities enriches pupils’ wellbeing.     4. THE QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT   The quality of leadership and management is very good. In questionnaires, all parents reported that there is a good atmosphere in the school and that they feel welcome in the school.   The principal has a clear and well-informed vision for school development and has worked very successfully to manage, lead and mediate change in the school. He demonstrates very effective leadership skills and works purposefully to oversee the development of teaching and learning.    The experienced board of management functions very effectively, providing strong oversight of the work of the school and resourcing the school to a very high standard.   The in-school management team is motivated and committed to school development. Members share a broad range of duties; the team is very well placed to develop further as a strategic unit in the leadership of the school with a clear remit in monitoring ongoing school improvement.   Commendably, the school facilitates the placement of student teachers from initial teacher education school placement programmes.  5. THE QUALITY OF SCHOOL SELF-EVALUATION  The quality of SSE is good and the school has engaged very positively with the DEIS planning process. Clear actions have been implemented and progression in learning is evident. To enhance the process further, greater clarity in the setting of improvement targets is necessary.  In future SSE planning, school leaders should ensure that the praiseworthy achievements in their engagement with SSE to date are highlighted and that a more in-depth analysis of whole-school assessment data is undertaken. A clearer focus on a reduced number of evidence-based targets will provide greater clarity to the process.    Given the commitment and capabilities of the leadership in the school, and the very effective teaching skills evident amongst teachers, the capacity of this school to continue to develop is excellent.               Appendix  SCHOOL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT  Submitted by the Board of Management              Part A Observations on the content of the inspection report      The Board of Management of St. Patrick’s BNS Ringsend is satisfied that this WSEMLLP report is a fair and accurate reflection of our school.
