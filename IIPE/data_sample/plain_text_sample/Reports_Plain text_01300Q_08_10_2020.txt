THE QUALITY OF PUPILS’ LEARNING  The quality of pupils’ learning is good overall. Most pupils achieve a good standard in English and Mathematics with some pupils achieving very good outcomes. Some pupils have access to differentiated-reading material and writing tasks, with regular monitoring of progress and learning outcomes. Appropriate differentiation and monitoring of components of reading and writing should be in place for all pupils. Differentiated outcomes and tasks are in place for all pupils in Mathematics. Good use is made of resources to enhance pupils’ learning experiences. While all pupils engaged with tasks, some pupils experienced difficulties with sustained engagement. Where very good outcomes were evident, all pupils were provided with appropriately differentiated tasks which ensured sustained engagement and very good learning outcomes.  Tá cumas na ndaltaí sa Ghaeilge an mhaith.

Pupils are able to use complete sentences and are able to pose and answer questions confidently. They can perform a range of songs and poems competently. Pupils write regularly in Irish; more variety of writing tasks should be provided.   Pupil learning, observed during the evaluation, in Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE) Music, Visual Arts and Physical Education was praiseworthy. Skills development, guided discovery learning and pupil enjoyment received due attention in these lessons. Further development in short-term planning is required to ensure breadth, balance and consistency of pupil learning in subjects across the curriculum.    2. THE QUALITY OF TEACHING  The quality of teaching is good overall, teaching observed ranged from very good to satisfactory. Where very good practice was observed, teachers prepared appropriately differentiated tasks, communicated very clear expectations to pupils about behaviour, and used a range of teaching methodologies to promote purposeful pupil engagement. The school should ensure that this highly-effective practice is implemented in all lessons.   Teachers’ planning and preparation are good overall. Teacher subject knowledge in all settings is commendable. Engagement with the Primary Language Curriculum (PLC) is evident in teachers’ written plans.  Aistear: the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework has been implemented to a good standard in the school. Plans identify clear learning outcomes for most curriculum subjects. While short term plans are in place, development is required to ensure that all timetabled subject areas have appropriate learning outcomes in place for each fortnight to ensure breadth and balance across the curriculum.   The quality of teaching observed in special education settings is good. Relationships and interactions support a co-operative and productive learning environment. An awareness of pupils’ personal and learning needs is evident. While the Continuum of Support is being implemented, not all allocated time is being used to support pupils with the highest level of need. Timetables should now be devised in accordance with Department of Education guidelines in Circular No 0013/2017.  The school uses some diagnostic tests to identify pupils’ individual learning needs in aspects of literacy. The range of diagnostic testing should be expanded, particularly in Mathematics and reading comprehension, to inform learning targets to meet individual pupil need.   The overall quality of assessment is satisfactory. Teachers use a range of assessment tools. In some instances, very good use is made of this assessment information to identify learning needs and to plan for teaching and learning. A more consistent approach to the assessment of pupil learning across the curriculum is required.    3. THE QUALITY OF SUPPORT FOR PUPILS’ WELL-BEING  Support for pupils’ well-being in the school is highly commendable. There is a caring, inclusive and welcoming atmosphere throughout the school. A positive, collegial atmosphere prevails and teachers have participated in professional development to support pupil well-being.   A wide range of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities is provided and is impacting positively on pupils’ well-being. While pupils can discuss and demonstrate enjoyment of events, further consideration should be given to increasing opportunities for pupil voice and pupil leadership.  The school implements a cohesive, whole-school approach to the teaching of Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), Stay Safe, and Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE). Most parents who completed questionnaires agreed that the school helps their child’s social and personal development and that they were informed of the schools’ Code of Behaviour and the Anti-Bullying Policy. Communication of the school’s RSE policy should be enhanced.   4. THE QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT   The overall quality of leadership and management is very good. The board of management is very supportive of staff professional development and is committed to providing a safe, well-run, orderly school.  There is scope for more regular communication from the board. It is recommended that a report be issued regularly to the wider school community on the work of the school and the work of the board.  The principal demonstrates very good leadership skills and a strong commitment to teaching and learning in the school. The principal is aware of the school’s changing needs and has plans to address these needs.    The in-school management (ISM) team demonstrates highly-effective collaboration in the day-to-day management of the school with a clearly identified set of duties. Consideration should be given to reviewing the existing duties to ensure management of the planning and implementation of the school curriculum.  It is recommended that members of the ISM report on their work to the board of management.  There is very good communication between the school and parents. Parents are kept informed of the work of the school through a range of media. Questionnaires from parents indicate that most parents feel welcome in the school, know who to talk to if there is a problem and that the school helps their child with personal and social development. The school has established a parents’ association. They provide commendable support to the school to organise school and community events. While policies are available to parents, further development is required to involve parents in on-going policy development.  The school reported that it provides placements for student teachers regularly. Such engagement in initial teacher education programmes is welcome and is included among the Teaching Council’s Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers, as it can provide valuable benefits for teachers, pupils and the teacher education institute.   5. THE QUALITY OF SCHOOL SELF-EVALUATION  The quality of SSE is satisfactory. The school has identified problem solving in Mathematics as an area or development. Data has been gathered from parents. Further development is required to devise a plan to meet the school’s need. The school’s capacity to develop and implement recommendations is very good.               Appendix  SCHOOL RESPONSE TO THE REPORT  Submitted by the Board of Management               Part A Observations on the content of the inspection report       The Board is delighted that the inspection report has affirmed the hard work of the school in providing very high quality support for pupils’ well-being, as this is the cornerstone of our happy and productive learning environment. The Board also acknowledges the positive report on the leadership, teaching and learning in our school. Overall, the Whole School Evaluation process has been a valuable experience, giving us a good overview of the school and aids our prioritisation of work into the future.  Part B   Follow-up actions planned or undertaken since the completion of the inspection activity to implement the findings and recommendations of the inspection.        In response to the recommendations made, the school has taken the following actions:  The Special Education timetable has been updated and all hours are now allocated in accordance with circular 0013/2017.  Curriculum policy reviews will have an increased focus on whole-school approaches for differentiation of learning tasks.  Planning is now done on a fortnightly basis, rather than monthly, ensuring all areas of the curriculum are consistently covered.      A report is now shared with the school community after every Board of Management meeting.  Policy formation and reviews will involve input from the Parents’ Association, when Covid 19 guidelines allow for meetings to be held again.   Published October 2020 / Foilsithe Deireadh Fómhair 2020
